# ResumePro | Build Your Future with Neon Vibes OR girlie vibes

Hey there!  Welcome to **ResumePro**. LIVE: https://resume-pro-builder-eight.vercel.app/

I built this project because I was tired of boring, plain resume builders. I wanted to create something that feels futuristic, looks high-tech (hello, Purple Neon! 💜), and actually helps people get jobs. 

Whether you are a developer, a designer, or a student, this tool is designed to make your resume stand out in that "Cyberpunk" aesthetic we all love.

##  What's Inside?

* **Futuristic UI:** Dark mode by default with glowing neon purple accents. 🎆
* **Live Builder:** No more "Save and Refresh." Type your details and see the magic happen. ✨
* **Silky Smooth:** Powered by AOS (Animate On Scroll) so the website feels alive as you scroll. 🌊
* **Multi-Templates:** From "Classic Blue" to "Creative Pink," I've added options for everyone. 🎨
* **Safe & Secure:** Integrated with Firebase so your data stays yours. 🔐

## The Tech Stack (My Tools)

I kept the stack modern and fast:
* **Frontend:** React (Vite) - Because speed matters! ⚡
* **Design:** Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS for those glowy effects. 💅
* **Backend:** Firebase for Auth & Database. 🔥
* **Animations:** AOS.js for the "wow" factor. 🎬

A Little About the Design
I used a lot of Glassmorphism and Neon Glows. If you look at the Login and Signup pages, you'll see those cool robot illustrations that give it a real AI-builder vibe. It's fully responsive, so go ahead, try it on your phone! 📱

Made with 💜 and a lot of Coffee.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
